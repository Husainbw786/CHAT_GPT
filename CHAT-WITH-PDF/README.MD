# Ask Your PDF ðŸ’¬

This project allows you to ask questions about a PDF document by uploading the file and obtaining relevant answers. It utilizes the Streamlit framework for the user interface and incorporates various libraries for text extraction, text splitting, embeddings, and question-answering capabilities. 

## Features
- Upload PDF: Users can upload a PDF document for analysis and question-answering.
- Text Extraction: The project extracts the text content from the uploaded PDF file.
- Text Splitting: The extracted text is split into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- Embeddings: OpenAI Embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.
- Similarity Search: The project performs a similarity search to find relevant documents based on user questions.
- Question-Answering: The system uses a pre-trained language model to generate answers to user questions.
 
## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary PDF file ready for analysis.
2. Access the application through the provided local URL.
3. Upload your PDF file using the file uploader.
4. Enter your question in the designated text input field.
5. Click the submit button to receive the answer to your question.
